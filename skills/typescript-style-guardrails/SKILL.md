# Typescript Style Guardrails

## Overview

Enforce readable, boundary-aware TypeScript in strict codebases. Prefer code that a reviewer can parse quickly over clever inline type composition.
If the repository already documents a stronger local convention, follow the repository before applying this skill mechanically.

## Working Mode

1. Identify whether the code is a boundary type, an internal helper type, or UI-local state.
2. Optimize first for semantic clarity in signatures and exported APIs.
3. Use utility types as construction tools, not as the main surface a human reads.
4. Prefer lint-enforceable rules over taste-based advice.
5. If the repository already has a stronger local rule, follow the repository.

## Core Rules

### Prefer named types over inline type algebra

- Extract `Pick`, `Omit`, intersections, mapped types, and long unions into a named `type` or `interface` before using them in parameters, returns, props, or exports.
- Do not leave dense expressions like `Pick<Foo, "a" | "b" | "c"> & Bar` inline in a function signature unless the expression is trivially short.
- Name the type for the business meaning, not the mechanism. Prefer `VisibleSession` over `PickedSessionFields`.

### Use `interface` for object contracts and `type` for composition

- Prefer `interface` for exported object shapes that are meant to be implemented, extended, or merged naturally.
- Prefer `type` for unions, tuples, conditional types, mapped types, utility-type compositions, branded types, and extracted aliases.
- Do not force `interface` where the shape is fundamentally a union or type-level transform.

### Keep boundary types explicit

- Write explicit DTO or view-model shapes when a type crosses a service boundary, UI boundary, persistence boundary, or package boundary and the fields are stable.
- Use `Pick` or `Omit` only when the derived shape is tightly coupled to the source type and that coupling is useful.
- When a derived type starts accumulating exceptions, stop composing and write the object shape explicitly.

### Treat `null` as a contract, not a default

- Use `null` only when an external system, schema, protocol, or domain state explicitly distinguishes empty from omitted.
- Prefer `undefined`, optional properties, or absent fields for internal optionality unless the contract already uses `null`.
- Keep one absence model per boundary whenever possible. Do not mix optional, `undefined`, and `null` without a concrete reason.

### Avoid anonymous structural duplication

- Reuse shared entities and exported subpath contracts before inventing app-local duplicates.
- If a local shape differs for a real reason, give it a new semantic name and document the boundary.
- Do not import broad root barrels when the repository provides stable subpath exports.

### Keep React types boring

- Type props and state with named contracts when the shape is reused, edited, or non-trivial.
- Do not mirror props into state only to satisfy typing convenience.
- Avoid effect-driven type workarounds; derive values directly when possible.
- Keep component-local helper types local unless they cross module boundaries.

## Decision Rules

### `Pick` and `Omit`

Use them when:

- the source type is canonical
- the subset is small and obviously coupled to the source
- extraction improves reuse or prevents drift

Stop using them when:

- the field list is long enough to hide intent
- the resulting type appears in a public signature
- the subset represents a new domain concept
- multiple utility types are chained together to express one business type

Preferred rewrite:

```ts
type VisibleSession = Pick<Session, "id" | "status" | "updatedAt">;

function renderSession(session: VisibleSession) {
  // ...
}
```

Write the shape explicitly instead when the extracted alias still hides the business meaning.

### `null` vs `undefined`

Use `T | null` when:

- a database column is nullable
- JSON or RPC payloads intentionally send `null`
- the domain has a real "present but empty" state

Use `?` or `undefined` when:

- a caller may omit the field
- the value is optional only during local computation
- the code is modeling partial construction, config, or component state

## Review Checklist

Check these in order:

1. Can a reviewer understand the exported type or function signature without mentally expanding utility types?
2. Does the type name communicate domain meaning instead of implementation mechanics?
3. Is `null` justified by a real boundary contract?
4. Is a shared contract already available?
5. Can the proposed rule be enforced by ESLint, TypeScript, or code review guidance?

## Implementation Notes

- Keep rule text short and directive.
- Prefer examples that show the before/after of a readability improvement.
- When proposing repo-wide rules, pair style guidance with lint rules or review heuristics from `references/external-guides.md`.
- If a repository already documents a different convention, record the exception instead of overwriting it silently.

- Read `references/external-guides.md` when you need upstream guidance or links to published style guides.
